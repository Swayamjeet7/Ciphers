<h2>The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts letters in a message to make it unreadable if intercepted.</h2>
<h3>It can be created by using list of specific characters, but here I have created the cipher by using the Unicode values.<h3>
<h3>In this code, you have to input a message and a key. The encrypted text is created by shifting up the message character by the key value. Unicode characters from 128 to 159 are control characters, meaning they're just not printable.</h3>
