<h2>The XOR cipher is done by taking the XOR value of the ASCII value of the message character with the key of same length.</h2>
<h4>Some of the output of the encryption may be blank due to the fonts of the device. But the encryption is done correctly which you can check by decrypting that same cipher.</h4>
